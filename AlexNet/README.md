# AlexNet Implementation
A toy project to learn, implement, and train the famous AlexNet Architecture from scratch from the 2012 paper
"[ImageNet Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2012/file/c399862d3b9d6b76c8436e924a68c45b-Paper.pdf)" simply because we can.

## Some Personal Details on Model Training
- Find a suitable batch size for training. Sticking to $128$ in accordance with AlexNet paper.
- Ensure that data preprocessing transformations are appropriate and desired.
